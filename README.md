<h3>I created a fun little program that will go and find the musical influences of any artist. It uses the Spotify APIs and a bit of logic.</h3>
<h4>The logic works like this:</h4>
<ol>
 	<li>Find the artist on Spotify</li>
 	<li>Go and find the earliest album that artist made.</li>
 	<li>Get the related artists and their first album date</li>
 	<li>Pick the related artist that has the closest album to 2 years before the original artist</li>
 	<li>Start back up with #3</li>
 	<li>Repeat until there are no artists left. Or until the program goes way off the rails.</li>
</ol>
<strong>Note: </strong>If there are no related artists with albums older than the oldest it will go back up the chain and try and find another route.

<h4>Example #1 - Pearl Jam</h4>

This has some pretty great results. Starting with Pearl Jam's first album Ten (1991), It goes all the way back to 1953 with decent results like Wire - Pink Flag, The Yardbirds - London 1963.

You will notice that it skips over bands like Nirvana because Nevermind was released in 1991 and that was the earliest album Spotify had. But, you get Soundgarden and Jane's Addiction instead, which when you listen to the albums they are great precursors.

Dr Dre had great results. Even though it started with 2001 instead of earlier stuff, it quickly jumped back to Warren G and then all the way back to Kurtis Blow.  

 After that, we hit on some awesome disco stuff like Inner Life - I'm Caught Up and and then to some baby making music Harold Melvin & The Blue Notes and Jerry Butler.  Love this one!  
 
 Finally finishes up with some Sam Cooke and everyone knows that Dr Dre was influenced by Pat Boone!
